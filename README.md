# Machine learning

A program that learns dots to move to a goal by mutating children of the dot that was the best of the dots in the earlier generation.


## Software Analyse

Processing:

Pros:

- Learning Java

- A library that allows me to display a screen fast 

Cons:

- A new environment



Atom and JavaC:

Pros:

- Atoms autocorrect

- Learning Java

Cons:

- I also need to sink time into displaying a screen

- need to manually compile every time I want to test my code



Unity:

Pros:

- A library that allows me to display a screen fast

- Strong API

- Lots of experience

Cons:

- Not learning any new language



Python idle:

Pros:

- I have lots of experience

Cons:

- I also need to sink time into displaying a screen. Or I have to use the turtle.



I chose to work with Processing. The only con I could think of is really a pro in my case. I want to work with more environments so it didn't bother me as much. As for the pros: I always loved java and wanted to get back into it again so it is really nice to do it here. And not having to worry about getting something on the screen is really nice too.



## Leerdoelen

- better knowledge of new languages(Java or Python)

- Getting a basic understanding of machine learning.



## Planning



| maandag | dinsdag | woensdag | donderdag | vrijdag |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| make git repo and change README.MD |making a screen with dots | Make the dots move randomly | kill a dot when it moves into a wall and let it finish in at a goal | make generations |
| continue work on generations | Wrap up | hand in product |  |  |
